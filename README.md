Create a `.env` file in the `/api` folder:

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
```

Start the backend server:

## 🧰 Test Admin Access

To try out admin features (dashboard, post creation, etc.), register a new user and update their role from the backend database or create an admin account manually.
